#### Spoiler warning: this post discusses (and thus, reveals) the outcome of *"Day of Reckoning"*. If you haven't already done so, I highly recommend you [read it first](https://someinfo.github.io/TekReckoning/), and only then return to this post.

Before we get to the reactions (mainly, TekRekt's), let's first go over the chat logs following the TekReckoning drop tease, which took place ~10 hours before the actual drop. 
## Those of you who read TekReckoning within its first few days must remember this screenshot, as I edited it in just before dropping the link in chat. I then said that I would edit with the aftermath, but have since decided to let the update have its own dedicated post.

TekDek: I aint accepting it if it aint from Daniel btw.
TekDek: cuz everything can be forge
TekDek: any attempt of false fake information should consider defeat
wantingsomeinfofirst: so true, king.
```
I think my reply to this has made him realize that the proof does actually come from Daniel (in the form of chat logs). It was at this point that he started getting anxious.

However, the important takeaway â€” and the reason I felt it necessary to include it in the TekReckoning just meanutes before posting the link in chat â€” was the meaning behind this:
  
```
StackGod2: @TekDek so if he proves you wrong will you voluntarily tell daniel to demod you?
TekDek: yesss, but that need to be verified
```
He stated that he intends to follow through with the bet. Toward the end of the screenshot, he lit up and laughed when I said that this doc just might be one huge apology be me, followed by the deletion of the account. ðŸ˜­ðŸ¤¡

Let's jump to the hour of the drop.

blablal and people had been talking about it even without my presence 

okay, let's entertain your "just for fun" pathetic claim: (from the vocab txt)

bro don't you know that whenever a whale is around who is willing to tip/do trivia for chat, tekdek gets on his hind legs and pings them 5 times, saying that he can help? @jack__frost that's why I knew there was a good chance he was not gonna follow through with the bet, but that doesn't make him 

to summarize, after solidifying himself as the ultimate clown in the TekReckoning, he managed to outdo even himself blabalbla

I know what you're thinking. Yes, I could've made this a whole lot shorter by featuring less screenshots and jumping straight to the point. However, the story you're about to read, my dear bustabit readers, is full of twists and revelations, and to maximize your enjoyment, I believe that providing context is a necessity. For the same reason, I also don't intend to provide you with a summary of what you're about to read, as I believe it would spoil the surprise, to an extent.

Kick back and enjoy as the story gradually unfolds before you. 


# Chapter I: The Mute

On Nov 19, I faked a rain on a beggar: 

![](https://i.imgur.com/STP5dLk.png)

I had been doing this for a while, up to that point: I'd spot someone in chat asking for bits, ask them something along the lines of, *"how much would make your day?"* And proceed to fake a rain on them. Not a single time had I been told or warned by a mod to stop. In fact, some of the mods definitely had seen these firsthand — potentially our protagonist, TekDek, too — because the beggars would sometimes get muted very shortly following my rain, if not immediately.
 
Back to the screenshot: Lehxus (the beggar) was baited in chat to [spam for a tip and subsequently got himself auto-muted](https://i.imgur.com/fX4tX5y.png). He then came back on a second account (bustabricked) to try and figure out why he had not received the rain on his first account. [AppleGuy showed up, so I showed him the screenshot and he proceeded to mute bustabricked and leave](https://i.imgur.com/TOFcRhD.png) (feel free to scroll down to the relevant red squares in the middle).
Lehxsus then returned on a *third* account, DBZ, and when I noticed TekDek was in chat, I suggested making him aware of the "issue", expecting TekDek to act similarly to how AppleGuy had handled it:

**Note: The screenshot provided by Loyalty is the screenshot I had taken and shown AppleGuy, as can be seen above.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/jd4acQr.png)

TekDek initially intended to let it go with a warning (*“I need you to stop doing fake rains”*). Yet, being the impressionable pathetic moron that he is, coupled with the fact that he had been trying to get rid of me for a while (funnily enough, because I had been saying that mods are biased/corrupt, among other things that are specific to him that I will not get into), after he was instructed: *“@TekDek lol fuck this, this is already getting out of hand, he’s been baiting people in chat nonstop for days; You need to mute him right the fuck now,”* by his idol, he typed *“yeah we had enough,”* and proceeded to do just that, ironically proving me right. It is safe to assume that he had not even seen the fake rain itself or the begging that preceded that (which took place ~70 minutes earlier, as I already mentioned), but more on that, later.

Many people were under the impression that I didn’t wager out of the mute (whose wager requirement was merely 10k bits) because of “ego”, but it is the other way around: I did not wager out of it *because* I *don't* have an inflated ego.

The mute clearly was *not* a mistake in good faith, and while the wager requirement was just 10k bits, if these unjustified mutes recur, it would just be a matter of time before I get locked behind a wager requirement that I'm not willing/able to wager out of. 

For that reason, I first decided to email Daniel and ask if he believed that the mute was justified. I iterated several times that I’m not looking to get unmuted by him; if I didn’t email him about the previous mute, while I was locked behind a 1 BTC wager requirement, then I sure as hell wouldn’t email him about a 10k bit wager requirement. I knew that Daniel would — as any other reasonable person — agree that the mute was unjustified, and his acknowledgement alone could serve as a deterrent and might ensure that TekDek won’t abuse his mod privileges to unjustifiably mute me moving forward.
 
Unfortunately, Daniel refused to look into it, and it was at this point that I realized that there’s no point to wager out of it at all, so I just walked away and let TekDek have the “W”. Would a person with an inflated ego do that? Or would they wager out of the mute right away, crack a joke in chat and make sure that the mod (and everybody else) knows that they aren’t fazed by it? 

In fact, roughly 16 hours after the mute, Homeless17 finally hit his then-goal of 9 BTC, and proceeded to tip a bunch of people, including me, 2.5k bits each (I was obviously muted, but also not online at the time. I asked about the origin of the tip on bustadice), so I could have gotten unmuted within a few seconds without even having to deposit anything. Also, a while later, ValidArgument was willing to tip me 10k bits for a quick unmute, and I also told him to not worry about it and asked him not to.

**I was aware that I couldn’t beat an impressionable and stupid mod, which is also why I chose to remain inactive even after Daniel randomly unmuted me *weeks* later, about a month and a half ago.** I simply preferred to remain inactive than be caught off-guard later, down the road, by additional mute(s) that I won't see coming and potentially won't be able to wager out of.

# Chapter II: The Audacity
On February 6, upon dropping a random message in chat, I was pinged with the following:

![](https://i.imgur.com/5tO0arv.png)

That was not the first time Stack had acknowledged it, as he has been laughing behind TekDek's back ever since the day of the mute. It also wasn't about the apology, because While I do think it is a dick move to exploit a stupid mod's impressionable and idiotic tendencies, it is pretty funny to get someone unjustifiably muted, as the responsibility would still lie with the mod. 

What I found interesting, then, was the last sentence: "*Apologies from me **and tekdek.**"*
I naively assumed that there was a slight chance that TekDek had sobered up and now finally acknowledges it, meaning that there would no longer be a reason to shy away from bustabit, as getting hit with an unjustified mute would probably no longer be bound to repeat itself. So, I decided to ask. 

Ladies and gentlemen, what ensued can only be described as the most impressive exhibition of delusion, irony, obliviousness, doubling down and lack of self-awareness I have ever witnessed on bustabit. 

For your convenience, I have emitted most of the irrelevant chatter, making the screenshots a lot shorter than they otherwise would have been, so that you wouldn't be inclined to skip. I believe the discussion (if I can even call it that) was entertaining enough to warrant a thorough read, but I still highlighted most of the important bits with some commentary.

![](https://i.imgur.com/KWcopAH.png)

A quick recap: 
Put aside the lack of self-awareness (calling *me* delusional and claiming that *he's* overwhelmed by the *"amount of ego,"* which was hysterical), his last point is one of many displays of sheer IQ superiority by TekDek. 

You heard it here, first, folks! If you ever get muted, simply:
   1. spam Daniel with unmute requests 
   2. keep complaining about it on bustadice
   3. take your frustration out on any mod that crosses your path.

Put aside my case, for a moment, too. The fact that he’s been around for years and actually believes that these steps would get *anyone* unmuted by Daniel... Amazing in and of itself. 🤡

Either way: (1) I already mentioned that I did *not* ask Daniel to unmute me (and on the contrary — reiterated several times that this was not what I was looking for).
As far as (2) and (3) go — also false. Up to the moment this conversation took place (February 6), I refrained from trash talking TekDek, not just on bustadice (never once even dropped the screenshot in chat), but privately, too. In *most* cases, whenever people asked about my mute in chat, I didn't even specify that he was the one who muted me and/or that it was unjustified. As I mentioned in the previous chapter and also in the screenshot, **AppleGuy and RabbitMilk both completely agree that the mute was unjustified**, and they also happen to be among the only ones who had seen the aforementioned screenshots up to that day (February 6). Other than these two, I had only shown the screenshots and provided context to two other people: Daniel (for reasons I already went over in Chapter I), and a completely random person on Discord; four people in total, three of which are mods.
 
Moving on:

![](https://i.imgur.com/bUiENHS.png)

Clearly, not even his idol was able to drill some sense into him, but it's probably more so the fact that TekDek's ego is too fragile to entertain the idea that he got played and/or was in the wrong. Either way, I realized that I'm talking to a brick wall, and intended to leave (*"okay man, have a nice day"*), however, he then decided to top up his already impressive flow of delusional bullshit with additional made-up fiction:

![](https://i.imgur.com/qCqJcUd.png)

> ### "he was warned multiple times for the same act he did the moment he got muted"

TekDek claims that he'd warned me multiple times to not fake rain. He decided he would die on this hill.

![](https://i.imgur.com/7YXESeH.png)

Just when you thought that TekDek couldn't make himself look even worse, he throws yet another incriminating bone into the mix, claiming that the person I "rained on" was innocent, and making himself look like even more of a clown. He will do that once again during the conversation, in between his barrage of false claims that he had warned me multiple times:

![](https://i.imgur.com/LFOsBRj.png)

```
TekDek: let me get this thing straight
TekDek: did you bait that man or not
```
It makes perfect sense that he would think so. After all, StackGod2's message to him right before the mute was *“@TekDek lol fuck this, this is already getting out of hand, **he’s been baiting people in chat nonstop for days**; You need to mute him right the fuck now.”* It seems like he is *still* under the impression that the guy got baited and was not an existing offender, which is idiotic, given that the very first screenshot on this page shows Lehxus blatantly begging, and I also posted the screenshot in chat, again, minutes before TekDek's message. 

Also, as I had been saying up to that point (and as can be seen in the screenshot) — the mute took place ~68 minutes after the ralnon, so it is more than likely that he had not seen it and/or the begging that preceded it, but as I previously mentioned, we'll revisit that point later. For now, let's focus on the nonexistent warnings. 

TekDek insisted about 9 times — during that conversation alone — that he had warned me not to fake rain (on beggars or in general) "5+" times, days before the day of the mute.

I obviously couldn't prove him wrong at the time, so I made sure that he understood what he was saying, and was planning to come back with the receipts. However, as days passed by, the motivation to prove him wrong had greatly diminished. There wasn't much incentive; would it even be worth the trouble? What would I gain out of it? Sure, proving someone wrong after they had backed themselves into a corner can be pretty satisfying, but other than that, the only upside would be chatting in peace without having to look around my shoulder (as he will have learned his lesson). That'd be nice, but too big of a deal to me, as I've been away from bustabit for a few months now. The effort:reward ratio was simply not worth it, because I knew that I wouldn't be able to half-ass things.

I was upset that I didn't get him to put his mod position on the line, seeing how his inflated ego would not let him accept the fact that he was wrong and/or got played.

# Chapter III: The Bet

Fortunately, about 10 days later, on February 17, I hopped on bustabit just in time to capitalize on a golden opportunity:

![](https://i.imgur.com/KIChPxj.png)

Given that TekDek had repeatedly claimed to have warned me not to fake rain "at least 5+" times prior to the day of the mute (*"200%; I'm certain"*), surely, he would be comfortable to place a similar bet with me; exactly what I had hoped for, following February 6. And so, I made the pitch:

![](https://i.imgur.com/B6nArv7.png)

As you can see, I was being more than fair: I lowered the requirement from 5+ warnings (which is something *he himself* had repeatedly claimed) to just two. In addition, not only have I agreed to the extension of the time frame from merely *"days before the mute"* (again, which is something that *he* had repeatedly claimed) to *"in that month,"* which would only qualify the month of November, but I pushed it farther back to *"**within** 30 days prior."* That alone adds about 11 additional qualifying days from October, given that the mute took place on November 19.  

While taking the screenshots, I noticed that I'd repeatedly written *"prior to the **mute**"* rather than *"prior to the **rain**."* You probably do remember [the warning that took place literally seconds before he was trolling into unjustifiably muting me](https://i.imgur.com/jd4acQr.png) (the last screenshot featured in chapter II):

```
TekDek: @wantingsomeinfofirst I need you to stop doing fake rains
StackGod: @TekDek lol fuck this, this is already getting out of hand, he’s been baiting people in chat nonstop for days
StackGod: You need to mute him right the fuck now
TekDek: yeah we had enough
*wantimgsomeinfofirst has been muted for: "fake rains"*
```

TekDek argues that he had warned me at least five times in a span of a few days, so surely, a warning which took place ~70 minutes *after* the rain which he allegedly muted me for, and seconds before the actual mute, would not count, right? The whole premise behind the bet is to prove that the mute was justified because he had warned me before hand — I.e., before the *last rain*. Trivial, is it not?

![](https://i.imgur.com/K9Alewe.png)

Apparently, TekDek does not care for logic (*surprised Pikachu face*).
This situation is already simple as is, but just to emphasize how absurd his claim is, let's simplify it even further:
```
16:27: !RAlNON @LEHXUS 6000
17:35: TekDek: "@wantingsomeinfofirst I need you to stop doing fake rains"
17:36: wantingsomeinfofirst has been muted for: "fake rains"
```
*"Of course the 17:35 warning counts! I did warn you not to fake rain before the mute!"* That is TekDek's claim, in essence. He also conveniently ignored me when I brought it up: 

![](https://i.imgur.com/GY5WQdz.png)

Alas, even if he insists to count *"@wantingsomeinfofirst I need you to stop doing fake rains"* as a warning, another fake rain warning would need to have been made for him to be declared the winner, and I was convinced that it didn't exist. For that reason, I figured that debating over the legitimacy of this rain, in the context of the bet, would be pointless. TekDek does get awarded with some well-deserved additional clown points, though. 🤡

# Chapter IV: The Revelation

On February 6, shortly after TekDek's extensive display of delusion, I emailed Daniel and asked for the chat logs. As shown and discussed in the previous two chapters, TekDek was *"200% certain"* that he had warned me *"5+ times, at least,"* prior to the Lehxus rain. It was ~10 days before the golden opportunity to lock in a bet, meaning that it was 10 days before I agreed to place a bet for "multiple" warnings (I.e., 2+, not 5+), within 30 days of the mute (and not *"just days"*). 

Already then I was very certain that he had not warned me. In fact, I was so certain, that I did not ask Daniel for the logs of just a week or two prior to the mute (which, at the time, would have sufficed to prove TekDek wrong), but for a whole **31** days. 

I received the chat log file ~14 hours later.

---------------------

### Before we get down to the juicy details, let us start with a little appetizer:

In Chapter II, I stated:
> Also, as I had been saying up to that point (and as can be seen in the screenshot, as well) — the mute took place ~68 minutes after the ralnon, so it is more than likely that he had not seen it and/or the begging that preceded it, but I will get back to that later.

When I confronted TekDek about this, roughly a week after the mute, he claimed that he was AFK and that once he returned, he scrolled up and saw the fake rainon. I replied that there was a ~70 minutes gap between the rainon and the mute, and the chat was rather active, so I suspected that he wasn't able to scroll that far back and still find context. Yet, he insisted that he did just that — scrolled up to the fake rain. He never mentioned that Loyalty had posted my screenshot, and I believe that he never bothered clicking on it. 

In case you guys aren't aware, even if you don't refresh bustabit's page on PC, there is still a cap on the number of messages that will be shown. After said number, each new message will remove the oldest one. **That number is 1000.** 

Don't believe me? [Here's a quick video I recorded that proves it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufb07bHqZwk). Pay attention to the row numbers. You're more than welcome to verify it on your own.

TekDek's first message back in chat was `2022-11-19 17:31:51	TekDek	such loyalty`. [It was before I wrote *"Here's TekDek,"* and before he knew what the commotion was all about](https://i.imgur.com/XtB2S8k.png). As shown, it's in the 475771st row of the chat logs. My rain message, `2022-11-19 16:27:29	wantingsomeinfofirst	!RAlNON @LEHXUS 6000` [is in the 474585th row](https://i.imgur.com/zw6kmgH.png), meaning that even if TekDek had scrolled all the way up the moment he returned to chat — *before he would even have a reason to so do* — he wouldn't have been able to find my rain — let alone the begging that preceded it — as there is a *1186* message gap between these two messages (475771-474585). Oopsie. 🤡📸

### The main course: 

Have I been warned by TekDek multiple times not to fake rain in the days/month leading up to the mute?

### Methodology:

#### First query:

In order to find fake rain warnings issued to me by TekDek, I started with the obvious: First, filter the raw data for entries which contain the keyword `TekDek`. Then, filter the results for entries that contain the keyword `wanting` (just in case he didn't properly ping me). These are the findings:

```
1. 2022-10-26 03:15:17	TekDek	@wantingsomeinfofirst who was it
2. 2022-10-27 10:08:52	TekDek	@wantingsomeinfofirst corrupt? excuse me
3. 2022-10-27 10:09:21	TekDek	@wantingsomeinfofirst I dont like the way you coming  at me like that
4. 2022-10-27 17:47:17	TekDek	@wantingsomeinfofirst @vehtje I need you to stop doing that
5. 2022-11-08 17:26:49	TekDek	@wantingsomeinfofirst lool
6. 2022-11-08 20:41:38	TekDek	@wantingsomeinfofirst completly a new man fr
7. 2022-11-18 04:23:06	TekDek	if you have problem with that, feel free to send a  support ticket @wantingsomeinfofirst
8. 2022-11-18 19:28:35	TekDek	the hatred from wanting LMFAO
9. 2022-11-18 19:56:11	TekDek	!def wantingsomeinfofirst
10. 2022-11-19 17:35:24	TekDek	@wantingsomeinfofirst I need you to stop doing fake rains
```
Bonus find: 
```
2022-11-18 19:50:41	StackGod2	@TekDek How much to mute wanting?
2022-11-18 19:51:16	TekDek	   @StackGod2 just need a little more spamming and it would be free 🙊🙈😜
```
He ended up pleasing his master within 20 hours. 🤡

The ninth entry is the warning which took place seconds before he was trolled into muting me, ~70 minutes after the rain. We already discussed its legitimacy in the context of the bet, so we'll ignore it for now and will revisit it later, should it become relevant. Other than that, the fourth entry shows the most promise. Could it be it? Did he actually warn me not to fake rain on October 27 and I had completely forgotten? I have removed some of the irrelevant chatter in-between, to not make it unnecessarily longer than it could be:

![](https://i.imgur.com/spup33m.png)

Nope; it was concerning copy pastas. We could move on, but I believe that showing how the whole thing played out could provide some valuable insight:

I didn't complain about the warning, and did not paste any other pasta. [However, vehtje chose to ignore the warning, proceeded to paste 3 more, and TekDek muted him. Keep in mind that mute notifications don't show up in the chat logs, and the rest of the messages leave no room for doubt](https://i.imgur.com/OMjLYNn.png) (I again emitted much of the irrelevant chatter in-between, to make the screenshot shorter). About 7 minutes later, [shadow2poor posted a funny roast, so I asked TekDek if he was going to mute me if I replied](https://i.imgur.com/WnFkStn.png). As you can see, he replied that he would, and added that I should have gotten muted along with vehtje. How does it make sense, when I barely pasted a single copy pasta, *before the warning*, and did not post another copy pasta, afterwards? [I assume scrolling up made him realize that he was tripping, so this time, he didn't double down and probably acknowledged the fact that claiming I should have gotten muted along with vehtje was a stretch. He then proceeded to unmute vehtje, *"to be fair."*](https://i.imgur.com/eJWnbtS.png) No clue if it had anything to do with our argument or because his master was protesting the mute, as I had not argued that the mute on vehtje was unjustified.

I was warned and did not post any additional copy pastas. when I did want to post one, I first asked to make sure that it would be okay, and even though I was told that I'd probably get muted for it and I felt like it was bullshit, I still heeded the warning. **I clearly know better than to test a delusional mod on a power trip. If so, how does it make sense that I'd go on to fake rain even after I had been warned (allegedly) 5+ times within days prior to the day of the mute, according to TekDek?** Alas, we carry on.

So we couldn't find a `@wanting` fake rain warning, let alone a full `@wantingsomeinfofirst` one, which is already a bad sign for TekDek, as it seems like he has a preferred pattern to go about warnings: *"`@username`I need you to stop,"* sometimes followed by the specified action that he deems mute-worthy. Here's another example: `2022-11-18 14:29:26	TekDek	@toolz I need you to stop`. 

Nevertheless, that's just an indication, but certainly no proof; we are ought to be thorough. Maybe I was warned right after one of my fake rains and he simply didn't feel the need to ping me (though it would break his M.O)? It's possible that I had missed one of those. If so, they would still count as warnings; I wouldn't try to finesse. 

### Second query:

So, let's examine every single `!rain/on` `!raLnon` instance, just to alleviate any and all doubt. That will also allow me to prove some of the other things I've been saying. 

In order to that that, we'd first filter the raw logs for just those which contain the keyword `wantingsomeinfofirst`, and then filter the results for entries that start by either `!rain` or `!raLn` (as they both would already include `!rainon` and `raLnon`, respectively). These are the findings:

```

Next, perform two tasks for each `!rainon`/`!raLnon` entry:
1. Look up the logs of the username I faked a rain on (to check if I had been "raining" on existing offenders or if I baited random, innocent people, as TekDek claims).
2. look up TekDek's logs before *and* after each instance (to check if he was present during the rain and potentially witnessed it and if I had been warned multiple times by not to fake rain, as he claims, etc.).

❗**Pay attention to the timestamps, and also, do note that mute notifications do not show up in chat logs.**

   ```
   ❗ **Remarks:** Check [the guy's logs](https://i.imgur.com/8mfFM9j.png). This dude had been passive/begging for several hours at the time, tagging every single semi high roller player and asking for a tip. The logs might make it appear as if he was having conversation with them, but the truth is, that most of them didn't even type in chat (e.g: [Here's kiddo_'s logs](https://i.imgur.com/8jDd0Xk.png); not a single message in sight).

   Not only do the chat logs make it clear that TekDek was around to witness both of these fake rains on beggars (he was chatting in between), **but he also laughed after I "rained" on amireli! In fact, he also addressed it by declaring that he was going to mute him, and proceeded to do just that!**
   How do I know that he muted him when chat logs don't show mute notifications? Well, amireli31's last message was *"@wantingsomeinfofirst pls bro,"* but most importantly, I made a comment following the mute, and **TekDek even addressed my comment** and said that he has a high wager requirement.


   ![](https://i.imgur.com/o8ggTgV.png)
   
   To conclude: (1) Clearly not an innocent guy (a beggar, low-effort messages spammer, alt account, etc., the whole package); (2) TekDek was present in chat, definitely took note of the rain, laughed, *declared* that he was going to mute amireli31, muted him and then chatted about his wager requirement; (3) No warning was issued.

   ❗ **Remarks:** On February 6 (chapter II) I did mention (as shown in the screenshot) that I had only done a couple public rains and that TekDek wasn't even around to see them. I obviously don't need to justify an occasional fake public rain, as it's perfectly fine to do it sparingly, and people do that in front of TekDek all the time. Even so, I resumed reading the chat logs and found the context rather interesting: ragz faked a public rain, we told him it was a shitty attempt, and I then said that I didn't want to do one because then people would try to get me muted for it (indicating that I believe there's a distinction between public fake rains and a direct fake rain on beggars, given that I had yet to be warned for it), but I eventually did. [I also only "rained" on people who are already in on the joke and are well aware that I'm trolling](https://i.imgur.com/2A6slNi.png).
   Either way — as indicated by TekDek's before and after logs — no warnings issued to me by TekDek, whether he was around to witness the rain or not.

   ```
   ❗**Remarks:** Another "public" rain. 2 out of 3 people are already in on the joke (Locksterix: *"you cant fool me you cheap fool* 😂*"*). I was just [fuckin' around with 251000](https://i.imgur.com/Txo0rPH.png), he took me seriously so I decided to rain on him after he claimed to have blocked me. The logs I posted above happened right after (as indicated by the timestamp). That said — this is clearly a random fake rain and even RabbitMilk expressed the same sentiment when asked about it by 251000, about 20 minutes later:
   ```
   2022-11-18 22:06:49	251000      rabbitmilk u muting fools for fake rains still?
   2022-11-18 22:08:30	RabbitMilk	usually if they do it repeatedly and it gets annoying then yeah @251000
   ```
   Either way, no warnings issued to me by TekDek, whether he was around to witness the rain or not.
     
21. ```
   2022-11-19 16:27:29	wantingsomeinfofirst	!RAlNON @LEHXUS 6000
   ```
   ❗ **Remarks:** This is the rain that sparked it all, and has been already discussed at length (Chapter I & II). 
   (1) Clearly a beggar; (2) TekDek arrives ~70 minutes later and gets trolled into muting me:
     ```
   TekDek: @wantingsomeinfofirst I need you to stop doing fake rains
   StackGod: @TekDek lol fuck this, this is already getting out of hand, he’s been baiting people in chat nonstop for days
   StackGod: You need to mute him right the fuck now
   TekDek: yeah we had enough
   *wantimgsomeinfofirst has been muted for: "fake rains"*
   ```

### Third query:

But *WAIT*, maybe that's *still* not enough! So far, we were able to determine that TekDek had not *directly* warned me, and that he also had not warned (directly or otherwise) me in *proximity* to a fake rainon. Not only that, but as we've learned from the 7th rain entry, he was clearly in chat, laughed and went on to mute the beggar! Still, perhaps we could find a seemingly random instance where he had warned me spontaneously, just because the subject was brought up in chat?

To rule that out, we'll take the chat logs which contain the keyword `TekDek` and simply filter for any entries containing the word `fake`. Matching results:

```
	1. 2022-10-28 20:32:39	StackGod2	@TekDek get him, fake rian.
	2. 2022-11-09 14:47:16	detomaso	@tekdek wats the actual policy to mute fake Rainers or there isn't any
	3. 2022-11-18 12:31:48	TekDek	thats your second fake rain
	4. 2022-11-19 17:35:24	TekDek	@wantingsomeinfofirst I need you to stop doing fake rains
```
As previously discussed, we'll skip the 4th entry. You should all be well familiar with it by now. 

It seems like it's worth examining the first and third entry:

1. `2022-10-28 20:32:39	StackGod2	@TekDek get him, fake rian.`:

   Maybe StackGod2 was referring to one of my fake rains and TekDek followed up StackGod2's message with a simple "true, stop doing that?" If I had acknowledged it, it would be pretty damn hard to argue that I wasn't issued a warning by him.  

   [Here's the context](https://i.imgur.com/o6BebdP.png). Apparently, it happened right after the third rain instance (on forgedscammer) from the second query's list. We've already examined this one, so we know that TekDek's first message back in chat was ~4:20 hours later, followed by another message, almost 3 hours later:
   ```
   2022-10-29 00:47:18	TekDek	lol
   2022-10-29 03:27:57	TekDek	@MaryBrown613 haha fr
   ```
   That said, the logs (as shown in the screenshot) do provide some interesting context. We can infer that *forgedscammer* was muted by a moderator shortly after his messages, and my fake rain was meant to help him wager out of it. This is yet another example of a mod potentially witnessing the fake rain and not acting on it!

3. `2022-11-18 12:31:48	TekDek	thats your second fake rain`:

   [Here's the context](https://i.imgur.com/iM1gEEO.png).
   I wasn't even active in chat at the time. Apparently, Merimakichut was taking advantage of the hype in chat, as GodzillaVsKong had been legitimately raining, and faked rains in order to get random people's hopes up. Seems like everybody wanted him gone, and justifiably so; there's a clear distinction between this kind of rains and mine.

-------------

I also went ahead and filtered all chat logs that contain the keyword `TekDek` for just `stop`, and even that didn't bring anything worth mentioning. 

I think I've conducted a rather extensive and thorough search, so there is no point continuing this charade. 

As you might have noticed, I didn't upload the file containing the chat logs. I didn't forget; it was intentional, and not because I think Daniel would mind (had that been the case, it's safe to assume that he wouldn't have given me the file in the first place), but because it wouldn't prove that I haven't altered the files. I'll be more than happy to send the original file to TekDek for further inspection, whether he intends to ask Daniel for the same file or not. In fact, that is the reason why I specified the methodology, so you could follow my steps and confirm the authenticity of my findings.

# Chapter V: Conclusions

 As I stated in the first chapter ([as well as in chat, on February 6, as can be seen in the screenshot from chapter II](https://i.imgur.com/7YXESeH.png)): 

> *"@tekdek I'd been doing it for a week++ prior to that point (prolly like 0-2 times a day, as long as I was around to see a beggar asking for bits), and not a single time was I warned by a mod to stop. on the contrary -- some of them had seen it firsthand (potentially you, too) and proceeded to mute the beggar without telling me anything"* 

This is what I wrote — almost verbatim — to all three mods (Daniel, RabbitMilk and AppleGuy), and it was long before I got my hands on the chat logs.

TekDek argues ([chapter II, next screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/LFOsBRj.png)) that he had warned me *"at least 5 times or more"* just *"days prior"* (to the mute) about *"fake rain in general,"* and that he is *"200% certain about that claim."* 

Of course, to settle the bet in TekDek's favor - only 2 "fake rain" warnings by TekDek would suffice.

Now that we have examined the chat logs from October 20 through November 19, we can determine how accurate any of these claims are, starting with mine:

> "@tekdek I'd been doing it for a week++ prior to that point (prolly like 0-2 times a day..."

Even with both public rain instances (!rain 3 500) included, we arrive at a total of 21 rains in the span of 31 days — 0.6774 rains a day, on average. 
   
>  "... as long as I was around to see a beggar asking for bits)..."
   
All direct fake rain targets were existing offenders, bar the 19th one, whose target was a passive beggar (which is still a creative way of asking for bets, though, admittedly, still technically allowed on bustabit, to an extent).

> "and not a single time was I warned by a mod to stop."

Not a *single* time, unless we count [this](https://i.imgur.com/jd4acQr.png). 🤡

> on the contrary -- some of them had seen it firsthand (potentially you, too) and proceeded to mute the beggar without telling me anything"

As I prefaced, chat logs do not show notifications, so it naturally proves hard for me to point out more instances, but the 7th rain (on amireli31) is **more than enough to not only prove that some mods had seen it first hand and proceeded to mute the beggar without telling me anything, but more importantly — that I was also accurate when I said that TekDek was potentially among them, because he sure as hell was, and still did not warn me**.

That was damn accurate, if I do say so myself.
 
On the other hand, TekDek's claim:

> "he was warned multiple times for the same act he did"; "there were multiple warnings not just that day"; "at least 5 times from me or more;" "oh stop acting like you didn't get those from me"; "days prior, daysss, and I am 200% certain about that claim"

Nope, no, nope, and uh... No, nope.

I think that settles it, then: **TekRekt.** 

#### Thank You

**Thank you**, TekDek, for not only being deluded and impressionable enough to fall for your master's trolls, but also, **thank you** for choosing to double down as desperately as you have, by claiming that I'd been baiting innocent people and that you had warned me plenty of times leading up to the mute, to the point that you have dug yourself a hole. A hole so deep, that even your unjustifiably inflated ego can't help you climb out of. **Thank you** once more, for being moronic enough to place a bet for something that could be easily proven, and by doing so, giving me the much-needed incentive to prove you wrong.

I never cared for an apology, but at this point, I also do not care for your acknowledgement, as the chat logs leave no room for doubt. 

Surely, you will prove to us all that there is still a shred of dignity left in you by stepping down from moderation, as you said you would. 

Is there?

**EDIT:**
Earlier today I dropped by chat and was too tempted to address TekDek's remarks. I'll include the screenshot for your enjoyment. I emitted off-topic messages (and thankfully, there weren't many):

We shall see if he is a man of his word soon enough!

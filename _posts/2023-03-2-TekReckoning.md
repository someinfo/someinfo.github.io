I know what you're thinking. Yes, I could've made this much shorter by featuring fewer screenshots and jumping straight to the point. However, the story you're about to read, my dear bustabit enthusiasts, is full of twists and revelations, and to maximize your enjoyment, I believe that providing context is a necessity. For the same reason, I also don't intend to provide you with a summary of what you're about to read, as I believe it would spoil the surprise to some extent.

So, kick back and enjoy as the story gradually unfolds before you. 


# Chapter I: The Mute

On November 19th, I faked a rain on a beggar:
<details>
  <summary><em>Screenshot #1.1</em></summary>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/STP5dLk.png">
</details>

I had been doing this for a while, up to that point. I'd spot someone in chat asking for bits, ask them something along the lines of, *"how much would make your day?"* And proceed to fake a rain on them. Not a single time had I been told or warned by a mod to stop. In fact, some mods had definitely seen these firsthand ‚Äî potentially even our protagonist, TekDek ‚Äî because the beggars would sometimes get muted shortly after my rain, if not immediately.
 
Back to the screenshot: Lehxus (the beggar) was baited in chat to [spam for a tip and subsequently got himself auto-muted](https://i.imgur.com/fX4tX5y.png). He then returned with a second account (bustabricked) to try and figure out why he hadn't received the rain on his first account. [AppleGuy showed up, so I showed him the screenshot, and he promptly muted bustabricked and left](https://i.imgur.com/TOFcRhD.png) (feel free to scroll down to the relevant red squares in the middle).
Lehxsus then came back on a *third* account, DBZ. When I noticed TekDek was in chat, I suggested making him aware of the "issue", expecting TekDek to act similarly to how AppleGuy had handled it:

<h4>Note: The screenshot provided by Loyalty is the screenshot I'd taken and shown AppleGuy, as can be seen above.</h4>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jd4acQr.png">
</details>

As can be easily inferred from the screenshot, TekDek initially intended to let it go with a warning (*‚ÄúI need you to stop doing fake rains‚Äù*). Yet, being the impressionable, pathetic moron that he is, coupled with the fact he had been trying to get rid of me for a while ‚Äî mainly, because I had been stating that mods are biased/corrupt (among other things specific to him which I will not delve into), so I hope the irony won't be lost on you ‚Äî it didn't end there. After his idol chimed in with, *‚Äú@TekDek lol fuck this, this is already getting out of hand, he‚Äôs been baiting people in chat nonstop for days; You need to mute him right the fuck now,‚Äù* TekDek typed, *‚Äúyeah we had enough,‚Äù* and without delay, did exactly that, ironically proving me right. It's also safe to assume he hadn't even seen the fake rain itself and/or the preceding begging, which happened ~70 minutes earlier ‚Äî but more on that, later.

Some people were under the impression that ‚Äúego‚Äù was the reason I didn‚Äôt wager out of the mute, whose requirement was merely 10k bits wagered. However, it's the other way around: I didn't wager out of it *because* I *don't* have an inflated ego.

The mute clearly was *not* a mistake in good faith, and while the current wager requirement was quite small, if these unjustified mutes recur, it would only be a matter of time before I get locked behind a wager requirement that I'm unwilling or unable to meet. 

For that reason, I first decided to email Daniel and ask if he believed that the mute was justified. I reiterated several times that I wasn't looking to get unmuted by him. If I didn‚Äôt email him about the previous mute when I was locked behind a 1 BTC wager requirement, then I sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt email him about a 10k bit wager requirement. I was confident Daniel would agree, as any other reasonable person would, that the mute was unjustified, and his acknowledgement alone could serve as a deterrent and might ensure that TekDek wouldn‚Äôt abuse his mod privileges to mute me without justification in the future.
 
Unfortunately, Daniel refused to look into it. At that stage, I realized there was no point in wagering out of it at all. So, I walked away and let TekDek have the ‚ÄúW‚Äù. Would a person with an inflated ego do that? Or would they wager out of the mute right away, crack a joke in chat, and make sure that the mod (and everyone else) knows they aren‚Äôt fazed by it? 

In fact, roughly 16 hours after the mute, Homeless17 finally reached his then-goal of 9 BTC and proceeded to tip a bunch of people 2.5k bits each, myself among them. So, I could have gotten unmuted within a few seconds without needing to deposit anything. Also, some time later, ValidArgument was willing to tip me 10k bits for a quick unmute, and I told him to not worry about it and asked him not to.

**I was aware I couldn‚Äôt beat an impressionable and stupid mod, which is also why I chose to remain inactive even after Daniel randomly unmuted me *weeks* later, about a month and a half ago.** I frankly preferred inactivity over being caught off-guard down the road by additional mutes that I wouldn't anticipate and potentially couldn't wager out of.

# Chapter II: The Audacity
On February 6th, upon dropping a random message in chat, I was pinged with the following:

<details>
  <summary><em>Screenshot #2.1</em></summary>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/5tO0arv.png">
</details>

That wasn't the first time Stack had acknowledged it; he's been laughing behind TekDek's back since the day of the mute. It wasn't about the apology, either, because while I do think it's a dick move to exploit a stupid mod's impressionable and ignorant tendencies, it is pretty funny to get someone unjustifiably muted, as the responsibility ultimately lies with the mod. 

What intrigued me, then, was the last sentence: "*Apologies from me **and tekdek.**"*
I naively assumed there was a slight chance TekDek had come to his senses and was finally acknowledging it. If that were the case, it'd make future unjustified mutes unlikely, meaning that there'd be no reason to avoid bustabit anymore. So, I decided to ask.

Ladies and gentlemen, what transpired can only be described as the most impressive exhibition of delusion, irony, obliviousness, doubling down, and a complete lack of self-awareness I've ever witnessed on bustabit. 

For your convenience, I've omitted most of the irrelevant chatter, making the screenshots much shorter than they otherwise would have been, so that you'll be more inclined to read through and not skip. I believe the conversation (if it can even be called that) was entertaining enough to merit a thorough read, but I've still highlighted most of the important parts with some commentary.

<details>
  <summary><em>Screenshot #2.2</em></summary>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/KWcopAH.png">
</details>

A quick recap: 
Leaving aside the lack of self-awareness (calling *me* delusional and claiming that *he's* overwhelmed by the *"amount of ego,"* which was hysterical), his final point is one of many instances of TekDek's sheer IQ superiority. 

You heard it here  first, folks! If you ever get muted, simply:
   1. Spam Daniel with unmute requests 
   2. Keep complaining about the mute on bustadice
   3. Take your frustration out on any mod that you come across

Setting aside my own case for a moment, the fact that he‚Äôs been around for years and actually believes these steps would get *anyone* unmuted by Daniel... Amazing in and of itself. ü§°

Anyway, (1) I already mentioned that I had *not* asked Daniel to unmute me (and on the contrary ‚Äî reiterated several times that this wasn't what I was looking for).
As for (2) and (3) ‚Äî also false. Until the time of this conversation (February 6th), I refrained from badmouthing TekDek, not just on bustadice (not once have I even dropped the screenshot in chat), but privately, too. In *most* cases, whenever people asked about my mute in chat, I didn't even specify that he was the one who muted me or that it was unjustified. As I mentioned in the screenshot, **both AppleGuy and RabbitMilk completely agree that the mute was unjustified**, and they also happen to be among the only ones who had seen the aforementioned screenshots by that date (February 6th). Other than these two, I had only shared the screenshots and context with two other people: Daniel (for reasons I already discussed in Chapter I), and a completely random person on Discord ‚Äî four people in total, three of whom  are mods.
 
Moving on:

<details>
  <summary><em>Screenshot #2.3</em></summary>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bUiENHS.png">
</details>

Clearly, not even his idol was able to drill some sense into him, but it's likely more so due to TekDek's ego, which is too fragile to entertain the idea that he got played and/or was in the wrong. Either way, I realized I was talking to a brick wall and intended to leave (*"okay man, have a nice day"*). However, he then decided to top up his already impressive flow of delusional bullshit with additional made-up fiction:

<details>
  <summary><em>Screenshot #2.4</em></summary>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/qCqJcUd.png">
</details>

> ### "he was warned multiple times for the same act he did the moment he got muted"

TekDek claims he'd warned me multiple times to not fake rain. He decided he would die on this hill.

<details>
  <summary><em>Screenshot #2.5</em></summary>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7YXESeH.png">
</details>

Just when you thought TekDek couldn't make himself look any worse, he throws yet another self-incriminating bone into the mix and makes himself look like even more of a clown, by claiming that the person I "rained on" was innocent. He'll repeat this later in the conversation, in between his barrage of false claims that he had warned me multiple times:

<details>
  <summary><em>Screenshot #2.6</em></summary>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LFOsBRj.png">
</details>

```
TekDek: let me get this thing straight
TekDek: did you bait that man or not
```
It makes perfect sense that he would think so. After all, right before the mute, StackGod2's message to him was: *‚Äú@TekDek lol fuck this, this is already getting out of hand, **he‚Äôs been baiting people in chat nonstop for days**; You need to mute him right the fuck now.‚Äù* I've been arguing all along that TekDek blindly follows his master's orders with no fact-checking whatsoever. That said, it now became abundantly clear that he *still* believes Lehxus was baited and wasn't an existing offender! That's so ridiculous, given that the screenshot of the fake rain (*Screenshot #1.1*) also includes the messages leading up to it ‚Äî Lehxus blatantly begging! Fast forward to the current conversation (February 6th), and I even posted the same screenshot in chat, again, minutes before TekDek's message! 

Additionally, as I had been mentioning up to that point (and as can be seen in the screenshot) ‚Äî the mute took place ~68 minutes after the ralnon, so it‚Äôs highly likely that TekDek hadn't seen it and/or the begging preceding it. However, as I previously mentioned, we‚Äôll revisit that point later. For now, let's focus on the nonexistent warnings. 

During that conversation alone, TekDek insisted ‚Äî about *nine* times ‚Äî that he had warned me against faking rain (on beggars or generally) *"at least 5 times or more,"* just *"days"* before the mute.

I obviously couldn't disprove him at the time, so I made sure he understood what he was claiming, intending to return with the receipts. However, as days passed, the desire to prove him wrong significantly diminished. There wasn't much incentive to motivate me; would it even be worth the effort? What would I gain from it? Sure, proving someone wrong after they had painted themselves into a corner can be quite satisfying, but beyond that, there was little upside. Chatting without having to look over my shoulder (as he'll have learned his lesson by then) would be nice, but not that big of a deal to me, as I've been away from bustabit for a few months. The effort to reward ratio was simply not worth it, because I knew that I wouldn't be able to half-ass things.

I was upset I didn't get him to put his mod position on the line, given that his inflated ego wouldn't allow him to accept the fact he was wrong and/or had been played.

# Chapter III: The Bet

Fortunately, around 10 days later, on February 17, I hopped on bustabit just in time to capitalize on a golden opportunity:

<details>
  <summary><em>Screenshot #3.1</em></summary>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/KIChPxj.png">
</details>

Given that TekDek had repeatedly asserted having warned me not to fake rain *"at least 5 times"* before the day of the mute (*"200%; I'm certain"*), surely, he would be comfortable to place a similar bet with me; exactly what I wished I had pushed for during the February 6th conversation. And so, I made the pitch:

<details>
  <summary><em>Screenshot #3.2</em></summary>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/B6nArv7.png">
</details>

As you can see, I was more than fair in my terms: I lowered the requirement from 5+ warnings (which is something *he himself* had repeatedly claimed) to merely two. In addition, not only did I agree to extend the time frame from just *"days before the mute"* (again, based on TekDek's repeated claims) to *"in that month,"* which would only qualify the month of November, but I extended it further to *"**within** 30 days prior."* That alone added about 11 qualifying days from October, given that the mute occurred on November 19th.  

While taking the screenshots, I noticed that I'd repeatedly written *"prior to the **mute**"* rather than *"prior to the **rain**."* You probably remember [the warning literally seconds before he unjustifiably muted  me](https://i.imgur.com/jd4acQr.png) (*Screenshot #1.5*, Chapter I):

```
TekDek: @wantingsomeinfofirst I need you to stop doing fake rains
StackGod: @TekDek lol fuck this, this is already getting out of hand, he‚Äôs been baiting people in chat nonstop for days
StackGod: You need to mute him right the fuck now
TekDek: yeah we had enough
*wantimgsomeinfofirst has been muted for: "fake rains"*
```

TekDek argues that he had warned me at least five times within a span of a few days, so logically, a warning that occurred ~70 minutes *after* the rain he purportedly muted me for, and seconds before the actual mute, wouldn't count, right? The whole premise of the bet is to prove that the mute was justified because he had warned me before hand ‚Äî before the *last rain*. Warnings don't apply retrospectively; I'd have to fake rain again ‚Äî *after* the warning ‚Äî for him to use *that* warning. Trivial, isn't it?

<details>
  <summary><em>Screenshot #3.3</em></summary>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/K9Alewe.png">
</details>

Apparently, TekDek does not care for common sense or logic (*surprised Pikachu face*).
This situation is already simple as is, but just to emphasize how absurd his claim is, let's simplify it even further:
```
16:27: !RAlNON @LEHXUS 6000
17:35: TekDek: "@wantingsomeinfofirst I need you to stop doing fake rains"
17:36: wantingsomeinfofirst has been muted for: "fake rains"
```
*"Of course the 17:35 warning counts! I did warn you not to fake rain before the mute!"* That is TekDek's claim, in essence. He also conveniently ignored me when I brought it up: 

<details>
  <summary><em>Screenshot #3.4</em></summary>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GY5WQdz.png">
</details>

Even if he insists on counting *"@wantingsomeinfofirst I need you to stop doing fake rains"* as a warning, another fake rain warning would need to have been issued for him to be declared the winner. I was convinced it didn't exist, which is why I considered debating over the legitimacy of this rain, in the context of the bet, to be pointless. TekDek does get awarded with some well-deserved additional clown points, though. ü§°

# Chapter IV: The Revelation

On February 6, shortly after TekDek's extensive display of delusion, I emailed Daniel and requested the chat logs. As shown and discussed in the previous two chapters, TekDek was *"200% certain"* that he had warned me *"5+ times, at least,"* prior to the Lehxus rain. This was about 10 days before the golden opportunity to lock in a bet; **10 days *before* I agreed to place a bet** for *"multiple"* warnings (i.e., 2+ and not *"5+"*), within the *30* days preceding the mute (and not *"just days"*). 

Already back then, I was incredibly certain that he hadn't warned me even once. In fact, I was so confident, that I didn't ask Daniel for the logs just from a week or two prior to the mute (which, at that time, would have been sufficient to prove TekDek wrong), but rather for the entire **31** days preceding the mute. 

I received the chat log file ~14 hours later.

---------------------

### Before we delve into the juicy details, let's start with a little appetizer:

In Chapter II, I stated:
> as I had been mentioning up to that point (and as can be seen in the screenshot) ‚Äî the mute took place ~68 minutes after the ralnon, so it‚Äôs highly likely that TekDek hadn't seen it and/or the begging preceding it. However, as I previously mentioned, we‚Äôll revisit that point later.

When I [confronted TekDek about this, roughly a week after the mute](https://i.imgur.com/BkD193j.png), he claimed that he was AFK and upon returning, scrolled up and saw the fake rainon. I replied that there was a ~70-minute gap between the rainon and the mute, and the chat was quite active, so it seemed unlikely he could scroll that bar back for context. Yet, he insisted he was indeed able to do that. He never mentioned Loyalty posting my screenshot, and I believe he never bothered clicking on it. 

In case you guys aren't aware, even if you don't refresh bustabit's page on PC, there's still a limit to the displayed messages. After a certain number, each new message replaces the oldest one. **That number is 1000.** 

Don't take my word for it ‚Äî [here's a short video I quickly recorded for proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufb07bHqZwk). Note the row numbers. You're also more than welcome to leave a bustabit tab open on PC and verify it on your own.

TekDek's first message back in chat was `2022-11-19 17:31:51	TekDek	such loyalty`. [It was before I wrote *"Here's TekDek,"* and before he knew what the commotion was all about](https://i.imgur.com/XtB2S8k.png). As shown, this message is in the 475771st row of the chat logs. My rain message, `2022-11-19 16:27:29	wantingsomeinfofirst	!RAlNON @LEHXUS 6000` [is in the 474585th row](https://i.imgur.com/zw6kmgH.png). This means that even if TekDek had scrolled all the way up the moment he returned to chat ‚Äî *before he had a reason to do so* ‚Äî he wouldn't have been able to find my rain, let alone the preceding begging, as there is a *1186* message gap between these two messages (475771 - 474585). Oopsie. ü§°üì∏

### The main course: 

Had I been warned by TekDek multiple times not to fake rain in the days/month leading up to the mute?

### Methodology:

#### First query:

In order to find fake rain warnings issued to me by TekDek, I began with the obvious: First, we'll filter the raw data for entries that contain the keyword `TekDek`. Then, we'll filter the results for entries containing the keyword `wanting` (just in case he didn't properly ping me). Here are the findings:

```
1. 2022-10-26 03:15:17	TekDek	@wantingsomeinfofirst who was it
2. 2022-10-27 10:08:52	TekDek	@wantingsomeinfofirst corrupt? excuse me
3. 2022-10-27 10:09:21	TekDek	@wantingsomeinfofirst I dont like the way you coming  at me like that
4. 2022-10-27 17:47:17	TekDek	@wantingsomeinfofirst @vehtje I need you to stop doing that
5. 2022-11-08 17:26:49	TekDek	@wantingsomeinfofirst lool
6. 2022-11-08 20:41:38	TekDek	@wantingsomeinfofirst completly a new man fr
7. 2022-11-18 04:23:06	TekDek	if you have problem with that, feel free to send a  support ticket @wantingsomeinfofirst
8. 2022-11-18 19:28:35	TekDek	the hatred from wanting LMFAO
9. 2022-11-18 19:56:11	TekDek	!def wantingsomeinfofirst
10. 2022-11-19 17:35:24	TekDek	@wantingsomeinfofirst I need you to stop doing fake rains
```
Bonus find: 
```
2022-11-18 19:50:41	StackGod2	@TekDek How much to mute wanting?
2022-11-18 19:51:16	TekDek	        @StackGod2 just need a little more spamming and it would be free üôäüôàüòú
```
He ended up pleasing his master within 20 hours. ü§°

The ninth entry is the warning that occurred seconds before he was trolled into muting me, ~70 minutes following the rain. We've already discussed its relevance in the context of the bet, so we'll set it aside for now and revisit it later, should it become necessary. Other than that, the fourth entry shows the most promise. Could this be it? Did he actually warn me not to fake rain on October 27th and I had completely forgotten? I have removed some of the irrelevant chatter in between, to not make it unnecessarily longer than it could be:

<details>
  <summary><em>Screenshot #4.1</em></summary>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/spup33m.png">
</details>

Nope; it was concerning copypastas. While we could move on, I believe showing how the whole thing played out could provide some valuable insight:

I didn't complain about the warning, and did not post additional ones. [However, vehtje chose to ignore the warning and posted three more shortly thereafter, resulting in TekDek muting him. Keep in mind that mute notifications don't show up in the chat logs, but the rest of the messages leave no room for doubt](https://i.imgur.com/OMjLYNn.png) (I've again omitted many irrelevant chat messages). About seven minutes later, [shadow2poor posted a funny roast, so I asked TekDek if he was going to mute me if I replied](https://i.imgur.com/WnFkStn.png). As you can see, he replied that he would, and added that I should've gotten muted along with vehtje. How does it make sense, when I barely posted a single copypasta, *before the warning*, and not a single one, afterward? [I assume scrolling up may have made him realize he was tripping, so this time he refrained from doubling down and likely acknowledged the fact that claiming I should have gotten muted alongside vehtje was a stretch. He then unmuted vehtje, *"to be fair."*](https://i.imgur.com/eJWnbtS.png) No clue whether this was due to our argument or if it was in response to master was protesting the mute, as I hadn't argued vehtje's mute was unjustified.

I was warned and did not post any additional copypastas. When I did wish to post one, I first asked TekDek, to ensure it would be okay, and although he replied that I'd *"probably"* get muted for it and I felt like it was bullshit, I still heeded the warning. **I clearly know better than to test a delusional mod on a power trip. If so, how does it make sense that I would go on to fake rain after being warned (allegedly) 5+ times within days prior to the day of the mute, as TekDek asserts?** Alas, let's move on.

So far, we couldn't find a `@wanting` fake rain warning, let alone a full `@wantingsomeinfofirst` one. This already doesn't bode well for TekDek, as it seems like he has a preferred pattern for warnings: *"`@username`I need you to stop,"* sometimes followed by the specified action that he deems mute-worthy. Here's another example: `2022-11-18 14:29:26	TekDek	@toolz I need you to stop`. 

Nevertheless, that's just an indication, but certainly no proof; we ought to be thorough. Maybe I was warned immediately after one of my fake rains, and TekDek simply didn't think it necessasry to ping me (even if it would deviate from his usual approach)? It's possible that I had missed one of those. If so, they would still count as warnings; I wouldn't try to finesse. 

### Second query:

Let's now examine every single `!rain/on`and `!raLnon` entry in order to alleviate any and all doubt. This might also help us examine a variety of other claims that have been made by both TekDek and me. 

To do this, we'll first filter the raw logs for entries containing the keyword `wantingsomeinfofirst`. Then, we'll filter the results for entries that start with either `!rain` or `!raLn` (which encompass `!rainon` and `raLnon`, respectively).

Next, perform two tasks for each `!rainon`/`!raLnon` entry:
1. Look up the logs of the username I faked a rain on (to check if I rained on existing offenders or baited random innocent people, as TekDek claims).
2. Look up TekDek's logs before *and* after each instance (to verify whether he was present during the rain and potentially witnessed it, and if he had warned me not to fake rain).

‚ùó **Pay attention to the timestamps, and keep in mind that mute notifications do not show up in chat logs.**

      ‚ùó <strong>Remarks:</strong> Check <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8mfFM9j.png">the guy's logs</a>. This dude had been passive/begging for several hours at that time, tagging every single semi-high roller player and soliciting tips. The logs might suggest he was having a conversation with them, the truth is, most of them didn't chat (e.g., <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8jDd0Xk.png">here are kiddo_'s logs</a>; not a single message in sight).

      The chat logs don't just provide evidence that TekDek was present to witness both instances of fake rains on beggars, <strong>but they also reveal that he found my fake rain on amireli31 amusing! In fact, he also addressed the fake rain by declaring his intention to mute amireli31, and followed through!</strong>
      How do I know that TekDek muted amireli31 when chat logs don't show mute notifications? Because I made a comment following the mute, and <strong>TekDek directly responded to my comment, </strong>addressing amireli31's high wager requirement:<br><br>

            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/o8ggTgV.png">
         </details><br>
   
      In fact, amireli31's last message that day was his very last message on bustabit, as <a href="https://www.bustabit.com/user/amireli31">he's still muted</a>.
      
      To conclude: (1) Clearly not an innocent guy (a beggar, low-effort message spammer, alt account, etc.; the whole package); (2) TekDek was present in chat, definitely took note of the rain, laughed, <em>declared</em> he was going to mute amireli31, muted him, and then chatted about his wager requirement; (3) No warning was issued.<br><br>

      ‚ùó <strong>Remarks:</strong> On February 6th (chapter II), I did mention (as shown in the screenshot) that I had only done a couple of public rains and that TekDek wasn't even around to witness them. I obviously don't need to justify an occasional fake public rain, as it's perfectly fine to do so sparingly ‚Äî many people do them in front of TekDek regularly. Nevertheless, I continued reviewing the chat logs and found the context rather interesting: ragz faked a public rain, we told him it was a shitty attempt (as the syntax was all wrong), and I commented that I didn't want to attempt one myself, because people might try to get me muted for it. This suggests that I recognized a distinction between public fake rains and direct fake rains on beggars, given that I had yet to be warned for either. However, I eventually did fake a public rain, but <a href="https://i.imgur.com/2A6slNi.png">I only included people who are already in on the joke and are well aware I'm trolling</a>.<br>
   
      Regardless ‚Äî as indicated by TekDek's "before" and "after" logs ‚Äî no warnings were issued to me by TekDek, whether he was around to witness the rain or not.<br><br>

      ‚ùó <strong>Remarks:</strong> This is the rain that sparked it all and has already been discussed at length (Chapter I & II).
      (1) Clearly a beggar; (2) TekDek arrives ~70 minutes later and gets trolled into muting me:

      <pre><code>  TekDek: @wantingsomeinfofirst I need you to stop doing fake rains
      StackGod: @TekDek lol fuck this, this is already getting out of hand, he‚Äôs been baiting people in chat nonstop for days
      StackGod: You need to mute him right the fuck now
      TekDek: yeah we had enough
      *wantimgsomeinfofirst has been muted for: "fake rains"*</code></pre>
    </details> 

### Third query:

But *WAIT*, maybe that's *still* not enough! So far, we've established that TekDek hadn't *directly* warned me;and that no warnings ‚Äî direct or otherwise, this time ‚Äî in *proximity* to a fake rainon. Not only that, but as we've learned from the seventh rain entry, he was clearly present in chat, laughed, and went on to mute the beggar! Still, perhaps we could find a seemingly random instance where he had spontaneously warned me, just because the subject was raised in chat? Maybe it was brought to his attention through DMs?

To rule that out, we'll sift through the chat logs containing the keyword `TekDek` and filter for entries which include the keyword `fake`. Here are the matching results:

```
1. 2022-10-28 20:32:39	StackGod2	@TekDek get him, fake rian.
2. 2022-11-09 14:47:16	detomaso	@tekdek wats the actual policy to mute fake Rainers or there isn't any
3. 2022-11-18 12:31:48	TekDek	        thats your second fake rain
4. 2022-11-19 17:35:24	TekDek	        @wantingsomeinfofirst I need you to stop doing fake rains
```
As previously discussed, we'll skip the fourth result. You should all be well familiar with it by now. 

It seems worth examining the first and third entries:

1. `2022-10-28 20:32:39	StackGod2	@TekDek get him, fake rian.`:

   Maybe StackGod2 was referring to one of my fake rains, and TekDek subsequently responded with a simple "true, stop doing that," or something similar? If I had acknowledged such a response, it would be pretty challenging to argue that I hadn't beem a warning by TekDek.  

   [Here's the context](https://i.imgur.com/o6BebdP.png). Apparently, this message was sent promptly after the third rain instance (on forgedscammer) from the second query's list. We've already examined this one, so we know that TekDek's first message back in chat was ~4:20 hours later, followed by another message, nearly three hours later:
   ```
   2022-10-29 00:47:18	TekDek	lol
   2022-10-29 03:27:57	TekDek	@MaryBrown613 haha fr
   ```
   That said, the chat logs (the last hyperlink) do provide interesting context. We can infer that *forgedscammer* was muted by a moderator shortly after his messages, and that my fake rain was seemingly intended to aid his wagering out of mute (by "giving" him 2k bits). This is yet another example of a mod possibly witnessing the fake rain and not acting on it!

3. `2022-11-18 12:31:48	TekDek	thats your second fake rain`:

   [Here's the context](https://i.imgur.com/iM1gEEO.png).
   I wasn't even actively chatting at the time. Apparently, Merimakichut was taking advantage of the hype in chat, as GodzillaVsKong had been legitimately raining, and faked rains to get random people's hopes up. Seems like everybody wanted him gone, and justifiably so; there's a clear distinction between this kind of rains and mine.

-------------

I also went ahead and filtered chat logs for entries containing the keyword `TekDek`, and sifted through those for ones containing `stop`, and even that didn't yield anything worth mentioning. 

At this point, I believe I've conducted a comprehensive and thorough search, so there is no point continuing this charade. 

As you might have noticed, I haven't included the chat logs file. I didn't forget to; it was intentional, and not because I think Daniel would mind (had that been the case, it's safe to assume he wouldn't have given me the file to begin with), but because it wouldn't prove that I haven't tampered with the logs. I'm more than willing to send the original file to TekDek for further inspection, whether he intends to ask Daniel for the same file or not. In fact, this is precisely why I've outlined the methodology in detail ‚Äî to enable you to follow my process and validate the authenticity of my findings.

# Chapter V: Conclusions

 As I stated in the first chapter ([as well as in chat, on February 6th ‚Äî *Screenshot #2.5*](https://i.imgur.com/7YXESeH.png)): 

> *"@tekdek I'd been doing it for a week++ prior to that point (prolly like 0-2 times a day, as long as I was around to see a beggar asking for bits), and not a single time was I warned by a mod to stop. on the contrary -- some of them had seen it firsthand (potentially you, too) and proceeded to mute the beggar without telling me anything."* 

This is what I've written ‚Äî almost verbatim ‚Äî to all three mods (Daniel, RabbitMilk and AppleGuy), as it's been my stance since day one; long before I got my hands on the chat logs or entered into a bet.

TekDek asserts ([*Screenshot #2.6*](https://i.imgur.com/LFOsBRj.png)) that he had warned me *"at least 5 times or more"* just *"days prior"* (to the mute) about *"fake rain in general,"* and that he's *"200% certain about that claim."* 

Now, after a thorough examination of the chat logs spanning October 20th through November 19th, we can finally evaluate the accuracy of these claims and ‚Äî more importantly ‚Äî settle the bet. Let's start with my claim:

> "@tekdek I'd been doing it for a week++ prior to that point (prolly like 0-2 times a day..."

Even with both public rain instances included (!rain 3 500), we arrive at a total of 21 rains over 31 days ‚Äî 0.6774 rains a day, on average. 
   
>  "... as long as I was around to see a beggar asking for bits)..."
   
All direct fake rain targets were existing offenders, bar the 19th one, who was a passive beggar (still an indirect form of asking for bits).

> "and not a single time was I warned by a mod to stop."

Not a *single* instance, unless we count [this](https://i.imgur.com/jd4acQr.png). ü§°

> "on the contrary -- some of them had seen it firsthand (potentially you, too) and proceeded to mute the beggar without telling me anything"

As I prefaced, chat logs do not include mute notifications, so it would naturally be challenging to point out more instances. However, the seventh rain entry from the second query (on amireli31, *Screenshot #4.2*) **undoubtedly confirms** not only that **some of the mods had witnessed my fake rainons firsthand and proceeded to mute the beggar without telling me anything**, but more importantly ‚Äî that **TekDek was indeed among them**.

Overall, it would be fair to conclude that my claims have proven to be pretty damn accurate, if I do say so myself.
 
On the other hand, let's be reminded of TekDek's claims:

> "he was warned multiple times for the same act he did"; ü§° "there were multiple warnings not just that day"; ü§° "at least 5 times from me or more"; ü§° "oh stop acting like you didn't get those from me"; ü§° "days prior, daysss, and I am 200% certain about that claim" ü§°

Nope, no, nope, and uh... No, nope. ü§°

In order to settle the bet in his favor, TekDek wasn't required to be anywhere *near* accurate! Instead of having to show a minimum of ***five* fake rain warnings** over **a few days**, as he'd been proclaiming this entire time, as few as just ***two* fake rain warnings** over **30 days** would have sufficed. And yet, here we are.

I think that settles it, then: **TekRekt.** 

#### Thank You

*Thank you*, TekDek, for not only being deluded and impressionable enough to fall for your master's trolls, but also, *thank you* for choosing to double down as desperately as you have, by claiming that I'd been baiting innocent people and that you had warned me plenty of times leading up to the mute, to the point that you have dug yourself a hole. A hole so deep, that even your unjustifiably inflated ego can't help you climb out of. *Thank you*, once more, for being moronic enough to place a bet for something that could be so easily proven, and by doing so, giving me the much-needed incentive to prove you wrong.

I never cared for an apology, but at this point, I also don't care for your acknowledgement, as the chat logs leave no room for doubt. 

Surely, you will prove to us all there's still a shred of dignity left in you, by stepping down from moderation, as you said you would. 

Is there?
